**University of Wollongong – MBAS906 (Trimester 2/2023)**  
**Author:** Wasupon (Petch) Arpornpattana

This repository presents analytics and strategy work for the **NMSS “Bike MS”** fundraising event.  
It combines *descriptive, predictive,* and *prescriptive* analytics to address declining participation and to identify actions that can lift donations.

---

## 🚩 Objectives
- Diagnose participant/donation trends and drivers  
- Build predictive models to test “what-if” scenarios  
- Deliver actionable strategies for participant growth (esp. corporate teams) and fundraising uplift

---

## 🔑 Key Findings (Executive Summary)
- **Participant uplift drives revenue**: a scenario analysis shows that **~10% more participants could increase total donations by ~18%**.  
- **Teams dominate donations**: corporate and team-based fundraising outperform individual riders; optimal team sizes and corporate engagement are critical.  
- **Targeted growth levers**: corporate teams (10–19 members), female participation growth, digital marketing, and strong team-captain enablement can improve outcomes.

> Full details are in the final report and presentation linked below.

## 🧠 Methods & Tools
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Forecasting (what-if)  
- **Stack:** SAS Viya, SQL/Excel/Power BI (for exploration and visuals)  
- **Process:** Data cleaning → descriptive & exploratory analysis → predictive modelling → prescriptive strategy

- Predictive models (decision trees & logistic regression) were built to classify engagement and understand drivers.  
- A **what-if forecast** indicates that **+10% participants ⇒ ~+18% total donations** (one-year horizon under stated assumptions).
